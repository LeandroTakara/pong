# How it works
- Player:
  - Moves at a constant velocity
  - W and S for the left player
  - ArrowUp and ArrowDown for the right player
  - Or by clicking or touching the respective player buttons
- Ball:
  - at the beginning of any round, it is sent in a aleatory direction with a random velocity
  - when it pass the left or right side, the other player scores one point
  - the farther it hits the player, the more speed it gets in the x and y axes
